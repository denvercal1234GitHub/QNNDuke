</h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I immigrated from Vietnam to the US at age 15. Despite having to learn English from scratch, I became the first in my family to attend college, thanks to scholarships and mentors through orgs, including the Bill & Melinda Gates, Dell, Greenhouse Scholars, National Institutes of Health, & National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth

    Following my graduation from Duke University in 2016 where I conducted HIV vaccine research at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute, I joined the US NIH Vaccine Research Center as a UGSP fellow to work on HIV cure
    
    In 2018, I moved to Europe to pursue an Erasmus MSc degree in Vaccinology on a full academic scholarship by the LIVE program, rotating through Spain, Belgium & France. Meanwhile, I worked remotely as a research manager for an international research network in public health, based in Hanoi, Vietnam
    
    Following my internship at GSK Vaccines, I received 3 full academic PhD scholarships from Oxford. As a DPhil student, I'm applying high-dimensional computational and experimental tools to discover novel human CD8 T cells with regulatory functions in lymphoid tissues. Manipulating the immune system through regulatory immune cells has applications in immunotherapy & vaccine R&D against viruses, cancers, autoimmune & even neurodegenerative diseases.
